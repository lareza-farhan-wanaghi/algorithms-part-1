## Description

This repository contains my solutions for the [Algorithm Part 1](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1) course assignments.


### Folder details

**1. hello** 

Solution for the week 1 section "Percolation" assignment. Activities involved: using a weighted union data structure to solve a scientific problem called percolation. [Learn more](https://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/assignments/percolation/specification.php)


**2. queues**

Solution for the week 2 section "Stacks and Queues" assignment. Activities involved: creating a data structure that can store and retrieve an item from the beginning and end of a collection by using 2-tail linked lists. [Learn more](https://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/assignments/queues/specification.php)


**3. collinear**

Solution for the week 3 section "Mergesort" assignment. Activities involved: making java comparators and sorting algorithms to find groups of collinear points. [Learn more](https://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/assignments/collinear/specification.php)


**4. 8puzzle** 

Solution for the week 4 section "Priority Queues" assignment. Activities involved: making an A* AI algorithm to solve n-puzzle problems. This is done by using manhattan distance as the heuristic and a Priority Queue data structure to iterate over all possible moves within a given puzzle.
